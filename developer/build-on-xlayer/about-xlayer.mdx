# X Layer overview

X Layer is a cutting-edge Ethereum layer 2 (L2) network built by OKX and Polygon using Polygon's CDK. Following the PP upgrade completed on August 5, 2025, it now supports throughput of up to 5,000 TPS with negligible gas fees. It offers full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to deploy existing Ethereum applications and develop new, innovative projects at a fraction of the cost compared to doing so on Ethereum. X Layer also enables users to use dapps at significantly lower gas fees and faster speed compared to Ethereum, with Realtime features providing ~100 ms transaction confirmations on testnet for DeFi/payments/RWA applications.

X Layer's underlying architecture is an EVM validium with Pessimistic Proof (PP) based cross‑chain finality. Transactions on X Layer are executed and validated by the EVM; ZK proofs are not used to secure intra‑L2 transactions. Instead, Polygon's PP system is only used when bridging/cross‑chain to provide verifiable finality on L1 or other domains. This differs from rollups (ZK or OP), and offers the following benefits:
- **Significantly lower fees**, since they don't consume expensive Ethereum gas, i.e., blockspace to store transaction data.
- **Significantly higher scalability**, since validium throughput is not bounded by the L1 data publication limit used by rollups.

For more detailed information, you can check out the X Layer architecture below.

## X Layer architecture
The major components of X Layer are:
- **Virtual Machine**: EVM‑equivalent
- **Mode**: Validium
- **Data Availability**: Off-chain storage
- **Consensus**: Polygon Pessimistic Consensus ([PolygonPessimisticConsensus.sol](https://github.com/okx/xlayer-contracts/blob/upstream/v9.0.0-rc.3-pp/contracts/v2/consensus/pessimistic/PolygonPessimisticConsensus.sol))
- **Sequencer**: Trusted (with double-check for validation) 
- **Gas token**: OKB (fixed supply at 21M post-burns/upgrades; L1 OKB phased out) 
- **Additional Features**: Realtime streaming for ~100ms confirmations, aggSender for AggLayer interoperability, SP1 Prover for pessimistic proofs

## Background
X Layer has migrated to the Pessimistic Proof (PP) mode introduced by Polygon. In PP mode, the L2 chain runs as an EVM validium with trusted sequencers and off-chain data storage, and PP is used only for cross‑chain settlement (e.g., withdrawals) to provide verifiable finality on L1.

## Architecture diagram and flow (PP mode)
Below follows the numbering in the diagram (coarse‑grained, simplified wording):

- 1.x User Tx path on L2
  - 1.1 User sends Tx → 1.2 Proxyd relays to Erigon RPCs
  - 1.3 RPCs route Tx to Pool Manager / other APIs
  - 1.4 Pool Manager pushes Tx to Sequencer pool；1.5 RPCs monitor receipts
  - 1.6 Sequencer writes Tx records to DB（Postgres）
- 2.x Sequencing, data and DS
  - 2.1 RPC gets Tx；2.2 Sequencer generates block
  - 2.3 Write chain data；2.5 Write DS data；2.6 DS Relay pushes DS；2.7 DS Relay writes DS DB；2.8 RPCs push DS
- 3.x/4.x Certificate & PP pipeline
  - 4.1 aggSender fetches blocks；4.2 Double‑check
  - 4.3 Send certificate to agglayer；4.4 agglayer submits PP to L1
- 5.x Contract event sync
  - 5.1 Bridge Service syncs L2 contract events
  - 5.2 Sync L1 contract events

Outcome: execution/finality happens quickly on L2; for cross‑chain actions, a certificate + PP is produced and verified on L1 to finalize withdrawals/messages.

This flow ensures fast execution on L2 while providing cryptographic settlement for cross‑chain operations without publishing full L2 data to L1.

## X Layer Validium & Pessimistic Proofs (PP)
X Layer is built with Polygon CDK, an advanced open‑source framework designed for the rapid deployment of EVM L2 blockchains on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/ "Ethereum").

X Layer adopts the validium mode with trusted sequencers, delivering a high‑performance L2 scaling solution. Following the PP upgrade on August 5, 2025, X Layer now achieves up to 5,000 TPS with negligible gas fees through seamless AggLayer integration, while maintaining full interoperability with other Polygon chains.

Since transaction data is not stored on the Ethereum mainnet, it is both executed and stored off‑chain, which massively enhances scalability. This validium approach reduces L1 gas storage costs and transaction fees for users, while providing enhanced privacy and user experience. The PP system further optimizes security by using pessimistic proofs that assume potentially malicious chain behavior, ensuring robust cross‑chain settlement.

For cross‑chain operations (for example, withdrawals and bridge messages), X Layer leverages Polygon's Pessimistic Proof (PP). PP produces a succinct proof that the claimed state transition is valid with respect to L2, enabling secure settlement on L1 without publishing full L2 transaction data.

## Validium vs. Rollups
Validiums differ from rollups and sidechains because they only share a proof of validity when needed (e.g., via PP for cross‑chain), which confirms the results of the transactions with Ethereum, not the actual transaction data of the executed transactions.
Here is how it operates: a verifier/bridge smart contract is deployed on Ethereum. For cross‑chain operations, the Polygon side `agglayer` submits a PP (ZK) certificate/proof to this contract on behalf of X Layer. The proof attests to the L2 state transition result but not the full transaction data.

The verifier contract assesses the validity of the submitted PP. If it is invalid, the claim is rejected and not stored/processed on Ethereum.

## Consensus & finality
X Layer uses a PoE‑based consensus on L2. Transactions are executed by the EVM and finalized on L2 by the trusted sequencer set. Cross‑chain finality is handled by the Polygon‑side `agglayer` subsystem: xlayer generates and stores certificate data (metadata/epochs), `aggsender` syncs and submits certificates to `agglayer`, and `agglayer`/`agglayer‑prover` submits PP proofs on L1. The two key flows are: **L2 block production & data writes** and **cross‑chain certificate + PP submission**. Participants include **Sequencer** and the **aggsender/agglayer** pipeline.

**Sequencer**: responsible for batching transactions on L2, producing blocks, and writing chain data.

**aggsender/agglayer**: `aggsender` fetches blocks/certificates from the node side, performs double‑check, and syncs the certificate to `agglayer`; `agglayer` (with `agglayer‑prover`) submits PP proofs on L1 to complete cross‑chain settlement.

## Data Availability
X Layer operates in validium mode with off-chain data storage, which provides:
- Lower transaction fees: reduced on-chain data storage costs
- Enhanced scalability: not bounded by L1 data publication limits
- State privacy: transaction data stored off-chain while maintaining security through PP proofs

## X Layer node
The X Layer node (based on `xlayer-erigon`) syncs with the L2 state. Trusted sequencers are responsible for managing L2 state and batching, while cross‑chain finality is handled by PP.

## Pessimistic Proofs (PP) for cross‑chain
For bridging and cross‑domain settlement, X Layer integrates Polygon's Pessimistic Proofs. During a withdrawal or cross‑chain message, an aggregator produces a PP that attests to the L2 state at a given checkpoint. This proof is verified by the L1 bridge/verifier contract before funds/messages are released on L1. PP is not used for day‑to‑day L2 transaction execution.

## Tokenomics
Following recent upgrades, OKB now has a fixed supply of 21M tokens after burning over 65M tokens and implementing contract upgrades that removed mint/burn functions. L1 OKB is being phased out as part of X Layer's transition to a self-contained ecosystem.

There are two main actors on X Layer that earn OKB as reward and pay OKB token as Gas fee for transactions at the same time.
### Sequencers
- Each sequencer is required to pay a fee in OKB tokens to have the privilege of creating and suggesting batches.
- When a sequencer successfully proposes valid batches containing valid transactions, they are rewarded with the fees paid by transaction requestors or network users.

### Aggsender & agglayer
- `aggsender` observes L2 blocks, performs double‑check, and pushes certificates to `agglayer`.
- `agglayer` (with `agglayer‑prover`) generates and submits PP proofs on L1; no PP is required for normal L2 transactions.
- Fees and settlement are tied to certificates that are committed and verified on L1 via `agglayer`.

## Transactions on X Layer
Before making any transactions on layer 2, users need to have OKB on X Layer. Per the latest OKX announcement, to obtain OKB on X Layer you should first deposit Ethereum L1 OKB to OKX Exchange and then use the "Withdraw to X Layer" one‑click swap. Over time, OKX Exchange will discontinue withdrawals of OKB back to Ethereum L1. See the announcement for details: [OKX: PP upgrade of X Layer and OKB gas optimization](https://www.okx.com/zh-hans/help/announcement-on-the-pp-upgrade-of-x-layer-and-optimisation-of-the-okb-gas).
2. Layer 2 transactions:
  - A user sends a transaction from their wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the network via Proxyd/RPC; the Sequencer includes it in an L2 block.
  - Once the Sequencer commits the block, the transaction is finalized on L2 (execution and fees are enforced on L2).
  - This L2‑final state has not yet been settled on L1. We refer to this as the **trusted (L2) state**.
  - For cross‑chain actions (withdrawals, bridge messages), xlayer produces a certificate; `aggsender` double‑checks and submits the certificate to `agglayer`.
  - `agglayer`/`agglayer‑prover` generates a Pessimistic Proof (PP) and submits it to the L1 verifier/bridge contract.
  - After the PP is verified on L1, the cross‑chain operation reaches L1 finality — the **verified state** for that operation. Day‑to‑day L2 transactions do not require PP.
