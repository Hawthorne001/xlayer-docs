# USDC on X Layer

![USDC workflow](./img/usdc.png)

## The difference between USDC and USDC.e

## USDC
Circle introduced the [Bridged USDC Standard](https://www.circle.com/en/bridged-usdc "Circle Doc") to ensure that chain operators can easily deploy a form of bridged USDC that is capable of being upgraded in-place by Circle to native USDC, if and when appropriate, and prevent any fragmentation problems. X Layer official bridge and OKX Exchange has supported this USDC following Circle Bridged standard. It is USDC-e in the flowchart.

|Asset|X Layer mainnet address|
|:----|:----|
|USDC|0x74b7f16337b8972027f6196a17a631ac6de26d22|

## USDC.e
There also exists a “bridged” form of USDC known as USDC.e, which is USDC that has been bridged from Ethereum issued by X Layer. It is BWUSDC in the flowchart.
