## FAQ
### How to clear your account activity/reset account in MetaMask？
You should only clear your account activity when strictly necessary, most often to **resolve stuck and pending transactions**. 

This function is intended primarily for developers, who may find it useful to clear an account’s activity on a test network while continuing to use the same account. 

Note that clearing account activity **only affects the current network**. For example: if you’re on **X Layer testnet**, the only activity that will be cleared are your transactions on **X Layer testnet**. Transactions on other networks, such as Ethereum, will be unaffected.

 <Tip title="Note">Clearing your activity is irreversible, and not a common requirement for most users.*You will not lose value in your accounts*.</Tip>

**To reset the account**:
1. Click the three vertical dots in the top-right corner, and then go to **Settings** > **Advanced**.

2. Scroll down to the **Clear activity and nonce data** section and click the **Clear activity tab data** button.

### How to reset the account in OKX wallet？
You should only reset your account activity when strictly necessary, most often to **resolve stuck and pending transactions**.

This function is intended primarily for developers, who may find it useful to clear an account’s activity on a test network while continuing to use the same account.

<Tip title="Note">Before resetting your account, you need to **back up your wallet**, or you *will lose value in your accounts*. For specific operations, please refer to this [OKX Wallet guide](https://www.okx.com/help/how-do-i-manage-my-wallet-web "OKX Wallet guide").</Tip>
