# About X Layer

X Layer is a cutting-edge Ethereum layer 2 (L2) network built by OKX and Polygon using Polygon's CDK. Following the PP upgrade completed on August 5, 2025, it now supports throughput of up to 5,000 TPS with negligible gas fees. It offers full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to deploy existing Ethereum applications and develop new, innovative projects at a fraction of the cost compared to doing so on Ethereum. X Layer also enables users to use dapps at significantly lower gas fees and faster speed compared to Ethereum.

X Layer executes and validates transactions on an EVM, with state and data maintained off‑chain. Routine L2 execution is EVM‑native; Polygon’s Pessimistic Proof (PP) is invoked only for bridging/cross‑domain settlement to provide verifiable finality on L1 or other domains. This contrasts with ZK/OP rollups where L1 data publication is part of the base protocol.
