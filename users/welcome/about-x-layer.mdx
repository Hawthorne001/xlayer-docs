# About X Layer

X Layer is a cutting-edge Ethereum layer 2 (L2) network built by OKX using the Optimism Stack (OP Stack) framework. Through extensive optimization and enhancement of the standard OP Stack, X Layer now supports throughput of up to 5,000 TPS with negligible gas fees. It offers full EVM equivalence (not just compatibility), enabling developers to deploy existing Ethereum applications without any modifications and develop new, innovative projects at a fraction of the cost compared to doing so on Ethereum. X Layer also enables users to interact with dapps at significantly lower gas fees and with faster transaction confirmation compared to Ethereum. X Layer leverages the battle-tested optimistic rollup architecture, where transactions are executed and sequenced on L2 with periodic batch submission to L1 Ethereum. The system assumes transactions are valid by default, with a 7-day challenge period for fraud proofs to ensure security. Unlike ZK rollups that require complex cryptographic proofs for every state transition, X Layer's optimistic approach allows for simpler and more efficient operation while maintaining the security guarantees of Ethereum. The implementation includes enterprise-grade enhancements such as the Conductor high-availability cluster for sequencer redundancy, ensuring 99.9% uptime for production environments. For more detailed information, you can check out the X Layer OP Stack architecture documentation.
